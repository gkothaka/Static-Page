      <h3 class="multicolortext">Visit to LinkedIn Office</h3>
      <p>
        As part of the LinkedIn Learning Champion program, I had an opportunity
        to visit the LinkedIn office at Chicago. It was a great learning
        experience because it provided me with an opportunity to engage with
        LinkedIn staff members. Thanks to Zachary Fiorella and Christine Gramlic
        (Knox) for giving a tour of the four floors. LinkedIn office is designed
        with different themes like music, gardens, and other things invented in
        Chicago. It felt like a place next to home and a positive work
        environment, it has an internal gym, game room, music room, cafeteria,
        pantries filled with lots of candies and sodas. One thing that grabbed
        my attention was the phone booths, where you can have your meetings and
        calls in absolute silence. The most amazing thing was, however, the
        lighting in the whole office. It is maintained keeping in mind the
        people suffering from migraine or any other eye related sensitivities. I
        happened to see a playful environment among employees, crediting each
        otherâ€™s work. I felt it was a perfect place to work at. Special thanks
        to Ima Bhattarai and Noel B. for making this possible. #lilchampions2020
